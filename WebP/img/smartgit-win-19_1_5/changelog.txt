    - author and date hard to see in dark theme for author != committer


Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- updated bundled Git to version 2.21.0
- Windows:
    - revealing a node programmatically does not scroll any more horizontally


SmartGit 19.1 preview 3 (2019-03-27)
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Git:
    - DeepGit:
        - added "Open SmartGit Log" and "Open SmartGit Root Log" to Navigation
          view
    - Discard: if > 1 file is discarded, show a second confirmation
    - JIRA/others: detect HTTP->HTTPS redirects and show a reasonable error
    - Log:
        - Branches:
            - Reveal: always asks for local/tracked branch if tracked branches
              are not shown
        - Commits:
            - optionally show only first parents; expandable on-demand
            - sorting options for
                - time,
                - primary parents first,
                - merge parents first
            - for Branch and Mergable coloring text of "non-matching" nodes is
              shown gray as for merge commits
        - Commits and Files: saves and restore states when switching between
          multiple open repositories
        - Files:
            - Directories:
                - Copy Name/Path/Relative Path: now also work for a commit
                  selection
            - empty untracked directories are only shown if "Show Unchanged" and
              "Show Untracked" is selected
        - opening: immediate loading feedback even for huge repositories
        - closing checks for running command as working tree window does
    - Log Graph/Journal: shows email addresses in tooltip
      https://smartgit.userecho.com/communities/1/topics/932-
    - Modify or Split Commit work flow improved:
        - the Continue option only is shown for no local changes (making
          creating commits more explicit)
        - no second commit is tried to be applied
        - warns if the commits are not diff-equal to the original commit (e.g.
          if something has removed intentionally or forgotten); optionally put
          remainder to the index
        - for each commit operation the original commit's message is suggested
    - Rebase Interactive, Modify or Split: warn if trying to modify pushed
      history
    - Refresh: shows warning for repositories with many unpacked refs
    - GitHub: option to create draft pull requests
    - Changes view: Edit in Index Editor: is now disabled if inapplicable
- Output view and dialog:
    - highlight links https://smartgit.userecho.com/communities/1/topics/336-
- default settings: if smartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefaults is
  configured, default yml files are processed specially:
    - a leading '-' for the key will delete this key from the settings file
    - for lists:
        - list items with the key-value "__merge__: delete" will be deleted
          from the list
        - other list items from the default yml file are prepended to the list
            - only if the list does not yet contain such entries (only the keys
              from the default list are used for the comparison)
- UI:
    - tables: low-level property ui.table.sortByMultipleColumns to disable
      sorting by multiple columns
    - Repositories view: low-level property repositories.sortFavoritesFirst to
      disable moving favorite repositories before groups
    - Find Command: full menu item name has higher priority now than "words"

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git:
    - Blame/Investigate: when invoking "Open Log" with "Existing Window" in
      file logs, the commit is not properly revealed
    - Log:
        - opening missing repository showed duplicate error dialogs
        - macOS: blurry graph on HiDPI screens
- Preferences:
    - Hosting Providers: possible internal error
- Repositories:
    - possible internal error invoking Copy ... on invalid repository
- themes: graph.merge.text was not honored

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Windows bundles: use JRE 11
- repositories-cache.yml has been replaced with a binary file repository-cache
  (no need to be editable)


SmartGit 19.1 preview 2 (2019-03-15)
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Git:
    - Add Repository: report details on possible problems instead of just
      considering repository as invalid (and thus asking whether it should be
      initialized)
    - Commit: support for empty commits, e.g. during cherry-pick - only if low-
      level property commit.allowToCreateEmpty is set to true
    - Ignore: allow to ignore directory with tracked files (to ignore *new*
      tracked files)
    - Log:
        - slightly larger arrows for thin (unpushed) connector lines
- Changes view:
    - for binary files the file size and hash always is shown; might cause
      problems with very large files
- Tools:
    - automatically add default tools except if they were deleted by the user
- Linux:
    - experimental support for delete-to-trash (move to
      "$(XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share)/Trash", "<partition>/.Trash" or
      "<partition>/.Trash-<uid>")
    - dark theme improvements:
        - table headers
        - Working Tree window, Changes view: HEAD/Working Tree side buttons
- Windows 10:
    - with dark theme scrollbars, menu, title bar are also dark (requires
      quite latest Windows 10 builds)
    - if the explorer is configured to be dark, too, even context menus are
      shown in black

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git:
    - Add or Create Repository, Clone: "repository is not valid" error
    - Commit: creating empty commit did nothing for normal state
    - Interactive Rebase:
        - Squashing/Edited Commit Message: possible "invalid line" errors
    - Log:
        - Commits: possible wrong combination of thin (pushable) and thick
          (pushed) lines
        - Refresh:
            - possible internal error for sparse checkouts
            - low-level property refresh.scanIntoSubmodules was ignored
        - title did not update when closing a repository
        - trying to open branch or Journal commit from Working Tree window in
          Log sometimes did not revealed the commit properly
- Linux:
    - hardly noticable caret in dark theme
    - tables in Edit | Customize dialog had bright background
    - wrong selection color is read from GTK
      https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=542469
    - duplicate window border on Elementary OS
      https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=542451
- Welcome dialog: possible duplicate entries
- startup: always asks for confirmation about crash footprints
- Spellchecker: performance problem for large text with unknown words and too
  long lines

====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Git:
    - Branches:
        - ahead/behind information includes now merged commits similar to
          "git status"
    - Commit: support for empty commits, e.g. during cherry-pick
    - Delete Branch: check for disallowing deletion of the current branch early
      (not just in command)
    - Fetch (background): option to cancel between fetches of different
      repositories
    - Git-Flow, Integrate: use Git's default message
    - GitHub: denote draft pull requests
    - Log:
        - Branches:
            - Reveal Branch: if tracking, optionally allow to always reveal the
              local branch without asking
        - Commits:
            - several performance improvements
            - Mergable coloring: start with black lines on first mergable
              commit
            - Reset Hard now possible on HEAD commit
            - sorting is slightly more consequent in keeping commit with its
              primary or merge parent together
        - Files:
            - optional directories tree
            - staging one file will select the next, not the 1st one
            - Show Unchanged Files works in Index mode, too
        - open submodules are updated immediately on change (even in non-
          active repository)
        - Split Commit: if rebase stops, the Index is selected
    - Journal: reorder and other commands use interactive rebase now for better
      performance
    - Interactive Rebase, Auto-Squash: added "To Last Commit" option
    - Open Repository: more detailed error in case of corrupt .git/index
    - Push To: for tags, "--force" is used now instead of "--force-with-lease"

    - support for /usr/bin/mate-terminal
- SSH: support for OpenSSHK Key (v1) by using SSHJ
- GUI:
    - Windows: sharper fonts and faster text drawing using GDI instead of GDI+

Fixed Bugs
----------
- BitBucket: Clone dialog showed wrong repository URLs
- Git:
    - Commit: Commit & Push may give "do you want to overwrite unseen remote
      changes" warning for merge commit
    - Git process invocation: native handle leak
    - Hosting providers: fixes to when which pull-request-related operations are
      available
    - Log:
        - Commits:
            - possible flickering when changing commits with Mergable Coloring
        - Distributed Reviews: display becomes confused when opening multiple
          repositories
        - when opening repository, filter is not applied immediately but only
          on second reload (which immediately follows first load and hence
          caused flickering)
        - File log: merging/rebasing state did not show up anymore
    - Rebase Interactive: Git >= 2.20 showed warning when cancelling rebase
- autoupdate: might fail to launch explorer.exe
- GUI:
    - drag and drop: possible dead-lock
    - restoring view after maximizing restored old size
    - Repositories | Create Group: warned about a group with same name in
      different group level

    - some rarely used encodings were missing

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- rewrote settings framework to save changed settings after a few moments; now
  uses YML format instead of XML
- switched to latest SSHJ library
- the default SSH library is now SSHJ; use low-level property ssh.impl to
  switch between SSHJ, JSch, Trilead
